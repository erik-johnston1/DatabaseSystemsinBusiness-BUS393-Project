# DatabaseSystemsinBusiness-BUS393-Project
This repository contains the file to construct, insert data, and test the functionality of the relational database for a fictional coffee shop called LES Coffee in SQL.

## Overview
The SQL database in this repo is the finished product of a class project where my group and myself were tasked with developing the business logic for a fictional business by defining the entities and rules required for day-to-day functions in a domain of our choice.

## Entities
• Barista  
• Customer  
• Order  
• Product  
• Payment  

## Business Rules
• Orders must be associated with at least one product and may have multiple payment methods.  
• Each product has a name, price, description, and type, and may be part of multiple orders.  
• Customers may be defined as a loyalty member and may place multiple orders. They may have one or many payment methods.  
• A payment method can be associated with one or more orders.  
• Barista can prepare multiple orders.
